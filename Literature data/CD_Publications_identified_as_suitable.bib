 abstract = {This paper presents a case study on the applicability of machine learning and big data technology for product cost estimation, using data on the material cost of passenger cars. The study provides contributions to six research aspects. First, we show which machine learning algorithms are appropriate when dealing with product cost estimation for highly complex products with more than 2000 parts and hundreds of cost drivers. Second, our case study provides a novel approach to increasing the predictive accuracy of cost estimates for subsequent product generations. Third, we show that the accuracy is up to 3.5 times higher when using big data compared to an intermediate size of data. Fourth, machine learning can outperform cost estimates from cost experts during the early stage of new product development, even when dealing with highly complex products. Then, we evaluate the use cases, issues, and benefits of machine learning and big data from the perspective of cost experts. Specifically, the case study shows that machine learning can reliably select the most important cost drivers (fifth aspect) and calculate the average cost of cost drivers over thousands of product configurations (sixth aspect). However, cost experts must be knowledgeable about the product and remain careful when interpreting machine learning outcomes, as they can yield misleading outcomes in some exceptional cases. In conclusion, machine learning and big data empirically proved to be able to generate additional value in many aspects for managing costs during the early phase of new product development. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {This article proposes a data-driven methodology to achieve fast design support to generate or develop novel designs covering multiple object categories. This methodology implements two state-of-the-art Variational Autoencoder, dealing with 3D model data, with a self-defined loss function. The loss function, containing the outputs of individual layers in the autoencoder, obtains combinations of different latent features from different 3D model categories. This article provides detail explanation for utilizing the Princeton Model-Net40 database, a comprehensive clean collection of 3D CAD models for objects. After converting the original 3D mesh file to voxel and point cloud data type, the model will feed an autoencoder with data in the same dimension. The novelty is to leverage the power of deep learning methods as an efficient latent feature extractor to explore unknown designing areas. The output is expected to show a clear and smooth interpretation of the model from different categories to generate new shapes. This article will explore (1) the theoretical ideas, (2) the progress to implement Variational Autoencoder to attain implicit features from input shapes, (3) the results of output shapes during training in selected domains of both 3D voxel data and 3D point cloud data, and (4) the conclusion and future work to achieve the more outstanding goal.},

 abstract = {Visual analogy has been recognized as an important cognitive process in engineering design. Human free-hand sketches provide a useful data source for facilitating visual analogy. Although there has been research on the roles of sketching and the impact of visual analogy in design, little work has been done aiming to develop computational tools and methods to support visual analogy from sketches. In this paper, we propose a computational method to discover visual similarity between sketches, considering the following practical application: Given a sketch drawn by a designer that reflects the designer's rough idea in mind, our goal is to identify the shape similar sketches that can stimulate the designer to make more and better visual analogies. The first challenge in doing so is how to discover the similar shape features embedded in sketches from various categories. To address this challenge, we propose a deep clustering model to learn a latent space which can reveal underlying shape features for multiple categories of sketches and cluster sketches simultaneously. An extensive evaluation of the clustering performance of our proposed method has been carried out in different configurations. The results have shown that the proposed method can discover sketches that have similar appearance, provide useful explanations of the visual relationship between different sketch categories, and has the potential to generate visual stimuli to enhance designers' visual imageries. {\copyright} 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

@proceedings{Zurita.2020,
 abstract = {During the design process, designers must satisfy customer needs while adequately developing engineering objectives. Among these engineering objectives, human considerations such as user interactions, safety, and comfort are indispensable during the design process. Nevertheless, traditional design engineering methodologies have significant limitations incorporating and understanding physical user interactions during early design phases. For example, Human Factors methods use checklists and guidelines applied to virtual or physical prototypes at later design stages to evaluate the concept. As a result, designers struggle to identify design deficiencies and potential failure modes caused by user-system interactions without relying on the use of detailed and costly prototypes. The Function-Human Error Design Method (FHEDM) is a novel approach to assess physical interactions during the early design stage using a functional basis approach. By applying FHEDM, designers can identify user interactions required to complete the functions of the system and to distinguish failure modes associated with such interactions, by establishing user-system associations using the information of the functional model. In this paper, we explore the use of data mining techniques to develop relationships between component, functions, flows and user interactions. We extract design information about components, functions, flows, and user interactions from a set of distinct coffee makers found in the Design Repository to build associations rules. Later, using a functional model of an electric kettle, we compared the functions, flows, and user interactions associations generated from data mining against the associations created by the authors, using the FHEDM. The results show notable similarities between the associations built from data mining and the FHEDM. We are suggesting that design information from a rich dataset can be used to extract association rules between functions, flows, components, and user interactions. This work will contribute to the design community by automating the identification of user interactions from a functional model.},

@article{Chen.2019,
 abstract = {Ideation is a source of innovation and creativity, and is commonly used in early stages of engineering design processes. This paper proposes an integrated approach for enhancing design ideation by applying artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. This approach consists of two models, a semantic ideation network and a visual concepts combination model, which provide inspiration semantically and visually based on computational creativity theory. The semantic ideation network aims to provoke new ideas by mining potential knowledge connections across multiple knowledge domains, and this was achieved by applying ``step-forward'' and ``path-track'' algorithms which assist in exploring forward given a concept and in tracking back the paths going from a departure concept through a destination concept. In the visual concepts combination model, a generative adversarial networks model is proposed for generating images which synthesize two distinct concepts. An implementation of these two models was developed and tested in a design case study, which indicated that the proposed approach is able to not only generate a variety of cross-domain concept associations but also advance the ideation process quickly and easily in terms of quantity and novelty. {\copyright} 2019},

@article{Deshpande.2019,
 abstract = {Computational methods for kinematic synthesis of mechanisms for motion generation problems require input in the form of precision positions. Given the highly nonlinear nature of the problem, solutions to these methods are overly sensitive to the input-a small perturbation to even a single position of a given motion can change the topology and dimensions of the synthesized mechanisms drastically. Thus, the synthesis becomes a blind iterative process of maneuvering precision positions in the hope of finding good solutions. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based framework which manages the uncertain user input and provides the user with a higher level control of the design process. The framework also imputes the input with missing information required by the computational algorithms. The approach starts by learning the probability distribution of possible linkage parameters with a deep generative modeling technique, called variational auto encoder (VAE). This facilitates capturing salient features of the user input and relating them with possible linkage parameters. Then, input samples resembling the inferred salient features are generated and fed to the computational methods of kinematic synthesis. The framework postprocesses the solutions and presents the concepts to the user along with a handle to visualize the variants of each concept. We define this approach as variational synthesis of mechanisms. In addition, we also present an alternate end-to-end deep neural network architecture for variational synthesis of linkages. This end-to-end architecture is a conditional-VAE, which approximates the conditional distribution of linkage parameters with respect to a coupler trajectory distribution. The outcome is a probability distribution of kinematic linkages for an unknown coupler path or motion. This framework functions as a bridge between the current state of the art theoretical and computational kinematic methods and machine learning to enable designers to create practical mechanism design solutions.},

 abstract = {During the initial stages of design, it is critical to conduct design space exploration studies and evaluate the design solutions against given criteria. These criteria correspond to the goals that the current design needs to achieve. When there is high dimensionality, the design space becomes very large which is hard to evaluate comprehensively. Hence, instead of searching the entire design space, multiple clusters are obtained based on the design performance objectives. By only exploring the subsets of the design space, the computational cost is diminished, making the design space exploration studies faster. As a use case, conceptual design of turbofan engines is illustrated since propulsion design necessitates a high dimensional design input. Initial sampling is performed using the design of experiments approach, then the design space is clustered based on specific fuel consumption at cruise and engine weight. Both of the design performance parameters are to be minimized to achieve the optimal design point. The best cluster is chosen and regarded as the new space to be explored. Same procedure is applied by following an iterative design space reduction methodology. Two different clustering algorithms are employed and their performance assessment is made. It is found that K-means clustering11K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, which assigns each data point to a group, given the attributes.

 abstract = {Supervised machine learning techniques have proven to be effective tools for engineering design exploration and optimization applications, in which they are especially useful for mapping promising or feasible regions of the design space. The design space mappings can be used to inform early-stage design exploration, provide reliability assessments, and aid convergence in multiobjective or multilevel problems that require collaborative design teams. However, the accuracy of the mappings can vary based on problem factors such as the number of design variables, presence of discrete variables, multimodality of the underlying response function, and amount of training data available. Additionally, there are several useful machine learning algorithms available, and each has its own set of algorithmic hyperparameters that significantly affect accuracy and computational expense. This work elucidates the use of machine learning for engineering design exploration and optimization problems by investigating the performance of popular classification algorithms on a variety of example engineering optimization problems. The results are synthesized into a set of observations to provide engineers with intuition for applying these techniques to their own problems in the future, as well as recommendations based on problem type to aid engineers in algorithm selection and utilization.},

 abstract = {Conceptual cost estimates are important to project feasibility studies and impact upon final project success. Such estimates provide significant information that can be used in project evaluations, engineering designs, cost budgeting and cost management. This study proposes an artificial intelligence approach, the evolutionary fuzzy hybrid neural network (EFHNN), to improve conceptual cost estimate precision. This approach first integrates neural networks (NN) and high order neural networks (HONN) into a hybrid neural network (HNN), which operates with alternating linear and non-linear neuron layer connectors. Fuzzy logic (FL) is then used in the HNN to handle uncertainties, an approach that evolves the HNN into a fuzzy hybrid neural network (FHNN). As a genetic algorithm is employed on the FL and HNN to optimize the FHNN, the final version used for this study may be most aptly termed an 'EFHNN'. For this study, estimates of overall and category costs for actual projects were calculated and compared. Results showed that the proposed EFHNN may be deployed effectively as an accurate cost estimator during the early stages of construction projects. Moreover, the performance of linear and non-linear neuron layer connectors in EFHNN surpasses models that deploy a singular linear NN. Crown Copyright {\copyright} 2009.},

As the project evolves, the team is expected to develop a shared understanding. However, students often become overwhelmed by the amount of information available and lose sight of the big picture. Instructors may also find it difficult to keep track of individual and team activities and are often forced to evaluate the product instead of the learning process.

This paper presents preliminary results from a tool that supports effective knowledge management for engineering design projects. This framework, called Design Webs, automatically extracts conceptual maps from the team's evolving set of documents and discussions about an engineering artifact. It uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation, hierarchical clustering, and other machine learning techniques to generate a navigable web-based graph. Both instructors and students can browse this graph interactively to explore the concepts embedded inside design team documents and the connections between them. An experiment performed on documents obtained from a project course shows the effectiveness of DesignWebs in synthesizing the design knowledge from multiple sources of information in engineering project teams.},

For aiding the designers on the HoQ analysis, the paper proposes an Apriori-based data mining approach to extract knowledge from historical data. The approach is mainly focused on mining potential useful association rules (including positive and negative rules) that reflect the relationships according to three objectives: support, confidence, and interestingness. For ensuring the availability and conciseness of these extracted rules, the definitions and calculations of rule conflict and redundancy are proposed and processing procedures are also developed to unite or delete unnecessary rules. The reserved rules are clustered in order to facilitate rule management and reuse. Furthermore, a reuse procedure is also developed for new HoQ analysis. Computational experiments of an electrically powered bicycle are used to illustrate the proposed approach and its capability of extracting useful knowledge.},

@article{Tucker.2009,
 abstract = {The formulation of a product portfolio requires extensive knowledge about the product market space and also the technical limitations of a company's engineering design and manufacturing processes. A design methodology is presented that significantly enhances the product portfolio design process by eliminating the need for an exhaustive search of all possible product concepts. This is achieved through a decision tree data mining technique that generates a set of product concepts that are subsequently validated in the engineering design using multilevel optimization techniques. The final optimal product portfolio evaluates products based on the following three criteria: (1) it must satisfy customer price and performance expectations (based on the predictive model) defined here as the feasibility criterion; (2) the feasible set of products/ variants validated at the engineering level must generate positive profit that we define as the optimality criterion; (3) the optimal set of products/ variants should be a manageable size as defined by the enterprise decision makers and should therefore not exceed the product portfolio limit. The strength of our work is to reveal the tremendous savings in time and resources that exist when decision tree data mining techniques are incorporated into the product portfolio design and selection process. Using data mining tree generation techniques, a customer data set of 40,000 responses with 576 unique attribute combinations (entire set of possible product concepts) is narrowed down to 46 product concepts and then validated through the multilevel engineering design response of feasible products. A cell phone example is presented and an optimal product portfolio solution is achieved that maximizes company profit, without violating customer product performance expectations.

@article{Matthews.2008,
 abstract = {Dynamic computer based support tools for the conceptual design phase have provided a long-standing challenge to develop. This is largely due to the 'fluid' nature of the conceptual design phase. Design evaluation methods, which form the basis of most computer design support tools, provide poor support for multiple outcomes. This research proposes a stochastic-based support tool that addresses this problem. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) is used to represent the causal links between design variables. Included in this research is an efficient method for learning a design domain network from previous design data in the structure of a morphological design chart. This induction algorithm is based on information content. A user interface is proposed to support dynamically searching the conceptual design space, based on a partial design specification. This support tool is empirically compared against a more traditional search process. While no compelling evidence is produced to support the stochastic-based approach, an interesting broader design search behaviour emerges from observations of the use of the stochastic design support tool.

 abstract = {This paper presents an AI-based pedagogical solution to aid designers in an appropriate analysis of existing product forms, and to provide feedback to them in the ideation of new forms pertaining to specific emotions and attributes. Sketching is often used as a tool for ideation and communication, especially by artists and designers. It is the non-ambiguity in the sketched representation that is crucial for the effective communication of ideas amongst the stakeholders involved in the product development process. Sketching, therefore, becomes the critical skill that an aspiring designer should acquire in design schools or during the learning phases of their careers. Hence, a pedagogical support system to assist novice designers in developing their ideas unambiguously through sketched representations is necessary. In this study, an image classification-based machine learning (ML) model is trained on a dataset containing images of lines. Further, this model is validated on a set of concept sketches, and a smartphone-based learning application for novice designers is proposed as a pedagogical feedback tool for the conceptual design stage. {\copyright} 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

@article{Li.2024,
 abstract = {Since innovation in complex product design hinges on thorough engineering knowledge application, high-quality patent recommendations foster innovation in engineering design. However, many patent knowledge recommendation studies perform patent analysis without comprehensive exploration and proper organisation of knowledge, causing a superficial understanding of patents and returning arbitrary results. To mitigate this issue, a deep learning-based approach for patent representation learning and knowledge recommendation is proposed. First, a four-dimensional patent knowledge model is defined to formalise the patent attributes that critically affect the engineering design outcomes, namely patents' domain(D), function(F), technology(T) and citation(C). Second, to exploit patent knowledge from their content and citation relationships, a representation learning approach integrating Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) and Graph Attention Network(GAT) is introduced. Thereafter a patent knowledge space is established in which each patent is characterised by the function, technology, and citation embeddings. Third, a knowledge requirement space is also constructed by vectorising a designer's search query via BERT model and linking it to a requirement-representing patent based on similarity. Finally, a recommender prototype is developed and showcased by the knowledge recommendation in sealing structure design tasks. Comparative experiments and application cases validate the effectiveness of our method in patent representation learning and knowledge recommendation. {\copyright} 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

@article{Mandolini.2024,
 abstract = {Recent scientific studies are targeted at applying and assessing the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) approaches for cost estimation during the preliminary design phases. To train ML prediction models, comprehensive and structured datasets of historical data are required. This solution is inapplicable when such information is unavailable or sparse due to the lack of structured datasets. For engineered-to-order products, the number of historical records is often limited and strongly influenced by different purchasing or manufacturing strategies, thus requiring complex normalisation of such data. This method overcomes the above limitations by presenting an ML-based cost modelling methodology for the conceptual design that is applicable even when historical data are insufficient to train the prediction algorithms. The training dataset is generated through an analytical and automatic software tool for manufacturing cost estimation. Such a tool, starting from a 3D model of a product, can quickly and autonomously assess the related cost in different scenarios. An extensive and structured training dataset can be easily generated. The proposed methodology was based on CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). Cost engineers of an Oil {\&} Gas company used the method to develop parametric cost models for discs and spacers of an axial compressor. The solution guarantees lower error (7{\%} vs 9{\%}) and significant time-saving (minutes instead of hours) than estimations based on other approaches. Cost models are more comprehensive (capable of analysing different scenarios), explainable (not conceived as a black box), and self-learning (can be updated by extending the training dataset). {\copyright} 2024 The Authors},

While the path synthesis of planar mechanisms is not a new problem, the effective representation of coupler curves in the context of neural networks has not been fully explored. This study compares four commonly used features or representations of four-bar coupler curves: Fourier descriptors, wavelets, point coordinates, and images. The results demonstrate that these diverse representations can be unified using a generative AI framework called variational autoencoder (VAE). This study shows that a VAE can provide a standalone representation of a coupler curve, regardless of the input representation, and that the compact latent dimensions of the VAE can be used to describe coupler curves of four-bar linkages. Additionally, a new approach that utilizes a VAE in conjunction with a fully connected neural network to generate dimensional parameters of four-bar linkage mechanisms is proposed.

 abstract = {Concept generation is a creative step in the conceptual design phase, where designers often turn to brainstorming, mindmapping, or crowdsourcing design ideas to complement their own knowledge of the domain. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) have led to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating seemingly creative outputs from textual prompts. The success of these models has led to their integration and application across a variety of domains, including art, entertainment, and other creative work. In this paper, we leverage LLMs to generate solutions for a set of 12 design problems and compare them to a baseline of crowdsourced solutions. We evaluate the differences between generated and crowdsourced design solutions through multiple perspectives, including human expert evaluations and computational metrics. Expert evaluations indicate that the LLM-generated solutions have higher average feasibility and usefulness while the crowdsourced solutions have more novelty. We experiment with prompt engineering and find that leveraging few-shot learning can lead to the generation of solutions that are more similar to the crowdsourced solutions. These findings provide insight into the quality of design solutions generated with LLMs and begins to evaluate prompt engineering techniques that could be leveraged by practitioners to generate higher-quality design solutions synergistically with LLMs.},

TRIZ provides Inventive Principles (IPs) and Contradiction Matrix that are the most frequently applied in conflict resolution. However, the high-level abstraction and subjective selection of IPs inhibit achieving the transformation process from paradoxical states to physical structures. To fill this gap, a contradiction solving method by integrating deep learning and technological evolution patterns for product conceptual design is proposed, which illustrates the mechanism of contradiction transition from the perspective of system evolution and supplies a systematic and model-based design approach. Firstly, generic engineering parameters are extracted to define the underlying contradictions transformed from critical defects which are found out through function modeling and root-conflict analysis. Then, a fully-connected deep neural network with excellent performance is developed to uncover the non-linear relationships between engineering parameters and evolution patterns. Finally, an evolution tree based on the predicted patterns is constructed to visualize transformation potentials of a technical system and help designers generate innovative specific solutions. In addition, a case study concerning design conflict resolution for beat-up system of three-dimensional tubular weaving machine is used to validate the adaptability and reliability of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {Design knowledge in the vast amount of design reports and documents can be an excellent resource for designers in their practice. However, capturing such domain-specific information embedded in long-length unstructured texts is always time-consuming and sometimes tricky. Therefore, it is highly desirable for a computer system to automatically extract the main knowledge points and their corresponding inner structures from given documents. In this study of document understanding for design support (DocUDS), a design-perspective knowledge extraction approach is proposed that uses phrase-level domain-specific labeled datasets to finetune a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model so that it can extract design knowledge from documents. The BERT model finetuning attempts to blend in the domain-specific knowledge of well-recognized domain concepts and is based on the datasets generated from design reports. The model is utilized to map the captured sentences to the main design entities {\textless}reguirement{\textgreater}, {\textless}function{\textgreater}, and{\textless}solution{\textgreater}. In addition, this approach uncovers inner relationships among the sentences and constructs overall structures of documents to enhance understanding. The definitions of design perspectives, inter-perspective relations, and intra-perspective relations are introduced, which together capture the main design knowledge points and their relations and constitute an understanding of the design domain knowledge of a text. The case study results have demonstrated the proposed approach's effectiveness in understanding and extracting relevant design knowledge points.},

@article{Zhu.2023,
 abstract = {Biological systems in nature have evolved for millions of years to adapt and survive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a specific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence (AI) for a data-driven approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a generative design approach based on the generative pre-trained language model (PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3), is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess the mapping relevancy between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The approach is evaluated and then employed in a real-world project of designing light-weighted flying cars during its conceptual design phase The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.},

 abstract = {Tire tread patterns have played an important role in the automotive industry because they directly affect automobile performances. The conventional tread pattern development process has successfully produced and manufactured many tire tread patterns. However, a conceptual design process, which is a major part of the whole process, is still time-consuming due to repetitive manual interaction works between designers and engineers. In the worst case, the whole design process must be performed again from the beginning to obtain the required results. In this study, a deep generative tread pattern design framework is proposed to automatically generate various tread patterns satisfying the target tire performances in the conceptual design process. The main concept of the proposed method is that desired tread patterns are obtained through optimization based on integrated functions, which combine generative models and tire performance evaluation functions. To strengthen the effectiveness of the proposed framework, suitable image pre-processing, generative adversarial networks (GANs), two-dimensional (2D) image-based tire performance evaluation functions, design generation, design exploration, and image post-processing methods are proposed with the help of domain knowledge of the tread pattern. The numerical results show that the proposed automatic design framework successfully creates various tread patterns satisfying the target tire performances such as summer, winter, or all-season patterns.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a predictive and generative design approach for supporting the conceptual design of product shapes in 3D meshes. We develop a target-embedding variational autoencoder (TEVAE) neural network architecture, which consists of two modules: (1) a training module with two encoders and one decoder ((ED)-D-2 network) and (2) an application module performing the generative design of new 3D shapes and the prediction of a 3D shape from its silhouette. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in the design of 3D car body and mugs. The results show that our approach can generate a large number of novel 3D shapes and successfully predict a 3D shape based on a single silhouette sketch. The resulting 3D shapes are watertight polygon meshes with high-quality surface details, which have better visualization than voxels and point clouds, and are ready for downstream engineering evaluation (e.g., drag coefficient) and prototyping (e.g., 3D printing).},

 abstract = {Selecting an appropriate set of the initial parameter for the aircraft conceptual design phase has a huge effect on the overall design result of the aircraft. Therefore, estimating appropriate combinations of the initial design parameters is an essential step for obtaining feasible conceptual design results. Existing methods selected the initial parameters by using empirical formulas or adopting the empirical parameters. These methods have limitations in that the design results are highly dependent on the user's experience and prior knowledge. Moreover, it is necessary to evaluate numerous empirical formulas to figure out the relationships between diverse combinations of variables. To overcome these limitations, this study applied data-driven machine learning techniques. The data-driven approach has advantages since it utilizes large, accumulated data and depends less on the user's experience. Therefore, data-driven machine learning models are utilized for the estimation of the initial parameters of aircraft conceptual design. Several machine learning models, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), variational autoencoder (VAE), and random forest (RF) are applied. These models are capable of handling incomplete and heterogeneous data. This is a huge advantage because most of the existing aircraft data are incomplete and composed of various data types. An incomplete dataset can be entered so that the model can directly learn from the data. The actual data of the aircrafts that served in World War II is gathered and utilized in this study. kNN, VAE, and RF have distinct learning tactics, so this study set the universal criteria to compare the performances of the three models. Furthermore, unlike other studies that require a complete dataset for training and validation, this study constructed the repeated imputation procedure and successfully assessed both models. As preliminary research, this study presented the validity of applying a data-driven approach to the aircraft initial sizing problem.

@proceedings{Akay.2021,
 abstract = {Nearly every artifact of the modern engineering design process is digitally recorded and stored, resulting in an overwhelming amount of raw data detailing past designs. Analyzing this design knowledge and extracting functional information from sets of digital documents is a difficult and time-consuming task for human designers. For the case of textual documentation, poorly written superfluous descriptions filled with jargon are especially challenging for junior designers with less domain expertise to read. If the task of reading documents to extract functional requirements could be automated, designers could actually benefit from the distillation of massive digital repositories of design documentation into valuable information that can inform engineering design. This paper presents a system for automating the extraction of structured functional requirements from textual design documents by applying state of the art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. A recursive method utilizing Machine Learning-based question-answering is developed to process design texts by initially identifying the highest-level functional requirement, and subsequently extracting additional requirements contained in the text passage. The efficacy of this system is evaluated by comparing the Machine Learning-based results with a study of 75 human designers performing the same design document analysis task on technical texts from the field of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). The prospect of deploying such a system on the sum of all digital engineering documents suggests a future where design failures are less likely to be repeated and past successes may be consistently used to forward innovation.},

@article{Jiang.2021,
 abstract = {The patent database is often used by designers to search for inspirational stimuli for innovative design opportunities because of the large size, extensive variety, and the massive quantity of design information contained in patent documents. Growing work on design-by-analogy has adopted various vectorization approaches for associating design documents. However, they only focused on text analysis and ignored visual information. Research in engineering design and cognitive psychology has shown that visual stimuli may benefit design ideation. In this study, we focus on visual design stimuli and automatically derive the vector space and the design feature vectors representing design images. The automatic vectorization approach uses a novel convolutional neural network architecture named Dual-Visual Geometry Group (VGG) aiming to accomplish two tasks: visual material-type prediction and international patent classification (IPC) section-label predictions. The derived feature vectors that embed both visual characteristics and technology-related knowledge can be potentially utilized to guide the retrieval and use of near-field and far-field design stimuli according to their vector distances. We report the accuracy of the training tasks and also use a case study to demonstrate the advantages of design image retrievals based on our model.},

@inproceedings{Kaliteevskii.2021,
 abstract = {Formalisation of heuristic methods for supporting the conceptual design stage of product and technology development has been extensively evolved in industry during the last half of the century and gradually more formally appears in academic context nowadays. Due to the considerable interest from the Industry and the Academia, heuristic approaches such as TRIZ have been strongly developed over the past decades. Thus, TRIZ evolved from a set of empirical inventive principles into a considerably formal approach including techniques for modeling technical problems with the possibility of further overcoming them using formal methods. Moreover, during the last decades, TRIZ has been extensively digitized. Several generations of software have appeared that facilitate the use of inventive methods (Goldfire, Invention Machine). From the trend of digitalisation and the success of machine driven processes, it can be assumed that the further fate of invention methods and formal algorithms for overcoming non-trivial problems lies in the plane of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence approaches. The position of the authors is that the idea of automating inventions looks extremely attractive, although in the coming time, digital approaches will rather complement the intelligence of engineers and scientists, rather than replace it. Taking a certain preparatory step towards AI driven inventions, we present a semantic model that can form the basis of future approaches, at the same time, having already sufficient functionality to support the heuristic stage of technology. As part of this work, over 8 millions of patents and scientific publications have been analyzed to extract semantic concepts.

Furthermore, more engineering changes are taking up a high amount of development resources. Therefore, the identification of effort for engineering changes is important to identify necessary resources. This paper introduces a methodology to build a model to predict engineering change requests' effort. Therefore, first a description model for engineering change is introduced. Afterwards, existing engineering change data has to be transferred into a data set by use of the description model. The build data set is split into training and test data to identify the prediction quality for unseen engineering change requests. Next, the prediction model is built in python by the aid of Sklearn, NumPy and Pandas. The results of the prediction model are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the conclusion suggests further possibilities to improve the prediction. {\copyright} 2021 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The reuse of design knowledge within a specific domain is currently a major research focus in product design. However, the importance of support from cross-domain knowledge is steadily on the increase for product innovative design, which includes multi-domain knowledge recombination, transfer and transformation. As the biggest knowledge provider, patent information plays an irreplaceable role inspiring designers in the conceptual design stage. Nevertheless, it is of a great importance and also an issue to figure out how to efficiently retrieve cross-domain patents. In this paper, we propose a function-based patent knowledge retrieval tool for conceptual design of innovative products. In order to establish the underlying local database, function information, technical terms and International Patent Classification (IPC) information are respectively extracted from patents crawled on Websites to represent function, technology and domain properties, thereby generating a patent knowledge space. Particularly, by using a semi-supervised learning algorithm, function information is automatically classified and labeled by functional basis, into which the design problem is abstracted and interpreted forming a design problem space. By functional basis mapping from the design problem space to the patent knowledge space, we retrieve the required cross-domain patents, which are then clustered and evaluated in accordance with the extracted technology and domain properties. The selected patents are thus purposefully recommended to trigger designers' creativity. Finally, a case study illustrates the conceptual design process based on the proposed retrieval tool. In addition to that, we conducted an experiment to verify our tool. It demonstrates that our proposed tool can assist designers to generate more ideas and the novelty of ideas is higher. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we propose a method for identifying a platform along with variant and unique modules in a product family using data mining techniques. Association rule mining is applied to develop rules related to design knowledge based on product function, which can be clustered by their similarity based on functional features.
