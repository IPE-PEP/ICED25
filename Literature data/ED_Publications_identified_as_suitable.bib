 abstract = {The initial concept of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) design is complicated and unique due to performance parameters like payload capacity, engine power, endurance, service altitude, etc. required to perform a wide range of missions. Empirical correlations between key design parameters can approximate initial characteristics but to explore the entire design space while considering sensitivities of interacting parameters, comprehensive, time consuming and computationally expensive trade-off studies are required to converge the early concept appraisal. The current paper explores the potential of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for rapid and accurate estimation of UAV design parameters in the conceptual phase by extracting knowledge from UAVs already in service. An ML framework based on five different regression models is formulated to estimate the parameters significant to mission profile using database of fixed-wing UAVs key design attributes. The predictive performance of the presented ML approach shows excellent agreement with the actual values during validation and comparatively, turns out to be more accurate than the existing methodology based on empirical correlations. Overall, ML techniques have a great potential for being applied as a surrogate model for evaluating novel UAV design concepts using less computational time and resources. {\copyright} 2024 THE AUTHORS},

@proceedings{Chen.2021,
 abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for computing the probability of constraint satisfaction in the context of reliability-based design optimization of complex systems, such as an aircraft. The constraint satisfaction is formulated as a classification problem, where an artificial neural network is employed to predict the corresponding probabilities. Different from existing approaches which require a double loop paradigm for either training or applying the artificial neural networks, the proposed approach is able to give probability prediction for any arbitrary point in the entire design space, using only one loop of model evaluations. As a result, the computational cost is reduced. An illustrative example is used to highlight the differences between the existing and proposed approaches. The usefulness of the latter is further demonstrated with an aircraft sizing case study. The results show that the proposed approach can provide reasonably accurate predictions for a realistic design problem. {\copyright} 2021 32nd Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2021.

@article{Deng.2021,
 abstract = {This paper proposes a new parametric level set method for topology optimization based on deep neural network (DNN). In this method, the fully connected DNN is incorporated into the conventional level set methods to construct an effective approach for structural topology optimization. The implicit function of level set is described by fully connected DNNs. A DNN-based level set optimization method is proposed, where the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (PDEs) are transformed into parametrized ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The zero-level set of implicit function is updated through updating the weights and biases of networks. The parametrized reinitialization is applied periodically to prevent the implicit function from being too steep or too flat in the vicinity of its zero-level set. The proposed method is implemented in the framework of minimum compliance, which is a well-known benchmark for topology optimization. In practice, designers desire to have multiple design options, where they can choose a better conceptual design base on their design experience. One of the major advantages of the DNN-based level set method is capable to generate diverse and competitive designs with different network architectures. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-based level set method.},

 abstract = {During each cycle of automotive development, large amounts of geometric data are generated as results of design studies and simulation tasks. Discovering hidden knowledge from this data and making it available to the development team strengthens the design process by utilizing historic information when creating novel products. To this end, we propose to use powerful geometric deep learning models that learn low-dimensional representation of the design data in an unsupervised fashion. Trained models allow to efficiently explore the design space, as well as to generate novel designs. One popular class of generative models are variational autoencoders, which have however been rarely applied to geometric data. Hence, we use a variational autoencoder for 3D point clouds (PC-VAE) and explore the model's generative capabilities with a focus on the generation of realistic yet novel 3D shapes. We apply the PC-VAE to point clouds sampled from car shapes from a benchmark data set and employ quantitative measures to show that our PC-VAE generates realistic car shapes, wile returning a richer variety of unseen shapes compared to a baseline autoencoder. Finally, we demonstrate how the PC-VAE can be guided towards generating shapes with desired target properties by optimizing the parameters that maximize the output of a trained classifier for said target properties. We conclude that generative models are a powerful tool that may aid designers in automotive product development.},

 abstract = {The authors present a generative adversarial network (GAN) model that demonstrates how to generate 3D models in their native format so that they can be either evaluated using complex simulation environments or realized using methods such as additive manufacturing. Once initially trained, the GAN can create additional training data itself by generating new designs, evaluating them in a physics-based virtual environment, and adding the high performing ones to the training set. A case study involving a GAN model that is initially trained on 4045 3D aircraft models is used for demonstration, where a training data set that has been updated with GAN-generated and evaluated designs results in enhanced model generation, in both the geometric feasibility and performance of the designs. Z-tests on the performance scores of the generated aircraft models indicate a statistically significant improvement in the functionality of the generated models after three iterations of the training-evaluation process. In the case study, a number of techniques are explored to structure the generate-evaluate process in order to balance the need to generate feasible designs with the need for innovative designs.},

@article{Chen.2021b,
 abstract = {Deep generative models are proven to be a useful tool for automatic design synthesis and design space exploration. When applied in engineering design, existing generative models face three challenges: (1) generated designs lack diversity and do not cover all areas of the design space, (2) it is difficult to explicitly improve the overall performance or quality of generated designs, and (3) existing models generally do not generate novel designs, outside the domain of the training data. In this article, we simultaneously address these challenges by proposing a new determinantal point process-based loss function for probabilistic modeling of diversity and quality. With this new loss function, we develop a variant of the generative adversarial network, named {\textquotedbl}performance augmented diverse generative adversarial network{\textquotedbl} (PaDGAN), which can generate novel high-quality designs with good coverage of the design space. By using three synthetic examples and one real-world airfoil design example, we demonstrate that PaDGAN can generate diverse and high-quality designs. In comparison to a vanilla generative adversarial network, on average, it generates samples with a 28{\%} higher mean quality score with larger diversity and without the mode collapse issue. Unlike typical generative models that usually generate new designs by interpolating within the boundary of training data, we show that PaDGAN expands the design space boundary outside the training data towards high-quality regions. The proposed method is broadly applicable to many tasks including design space exploration, design optimization, and creative solution recommendation.},

 abstract = {We propose a data-driven 3D shape design method that can learn a generative model from a corpus of existing designs, and use this model to produce a wide range of new designs. The approach learns an encoding of the samples in the training corpus using an unsupervised variational autoencoder-decoder architecture, without the need for an explicit parametric representation of the original designs. To facilitate the generation ofsmooth final surfaces, we develop a 3D shape representation based on a distance transformation of the original 3D data, rather than using the commonly utilized binary voxel representation. Once established, the generator maps the latent space representations to the high-dimensional distance transformation fields, which are then automatically surfaced to produce 3D representations amenable to physics simulations or other objective function evaluation modules. We demonstrate our approach for the computational design of gliders that are optimized to attain prescribed performance scores. Our results show that when combined with genetic optimization, the proposed approach can generate a rich set of candidate concept designs that achieve prescribed functional goals, even when the original dataset has only a few or no solutions that achieve these goals.},

 abstract = {3D CAD models have great significances for product lifecycle reuse as each model aggregates abundant knowledge in a vivid 3D CAD model and enables engineers to reuse the existing mature designs from a high-level perspective. The effective reuse of the pre-existing 3D CAD models could greatly save time and cost in new product development. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel view-based 3D CAD model reuse framework, which supports the effective reuse of 3D CAD models throughout the new product lifecycle by a deep learning approach. In this framework, each 3D CAD model is first represented by a series of orthogonal two-dimensional views, which contain rich spatial information for differentiating 3D CAD models. Then, we define the problem of model retrieval as a view recognition problem, where a deep residual network (ResNet) is successfully trained to facilitate the view-based 3D CAD model retrieval. With the learned ResNet, engineers could take the understandable views of a model that represent their query intents as input and acquire the relevant 3D CAD models for product lifecycle reuse. Finally, the typical application scenario demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed framework, and the evaluation experiments show the superiorities of ResNet used in this framework.},

Decision tree technique was used to mine the crash simulation datasets to identify the key design variables with most significant effect on the vehicular energy absorption response and determine the range of their values. In this way, the design space can be significantly reduced and the high-dimensional design problem is greatly simplified. The results suggest that the data mining based approach can be used to design a complicated structure with multiple parameters effectively and efficiently.

 abstract = {Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is one of the basic and the most commonly used techniques in reliability analysis and management. Design FMEA is the application of the FMEA method in product development phase and have shown remarkable results in various engineering design fields. DFMEA reports usually contain a lot of text information about quality and reliability improvement opportunities for new product development. However, it can be very difficult and non-intuitive to fully understand these text information for design improvements. To address this challenge, we propose to apply text mining methods in DFMEA reports to discover the hidden reliability information. Specifically, three types of hidden information are investigated, which include the correlation of the failure related features in the potential failure mode or failure cause, the classification of failure modes and causes, and the optimal set of improvement activities according to the effect and cost metric proposed in this paper. Among them, one feature represents a failure characteristic or a location of the potential failure mode or failure cause (e.g. wear, break, bend, surface, insert, stem). These three pieces of information can be further integrated to product verification and validation process for effective risk identification and mitigation in a more economic and effective way. Finally, we illustrate the application of the text mining methods in DFMEA report for a subsystem in a power generation system within a diesel engine. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Valuable implicit knowledge and patterns are accumulated over time in industrial databases at various stages of product development and production. An example of such hidden patterns would be the cutting tool which is typically used to produce a profiling feature in a given steel part. Discovering and interpreting such patterns would be useful in supporting and optimizing the operations and planning activities such as process planning and manufacturing systems synthesis. A novel knowledge discovery model is introduced to extract useful correlations between the manufacturing domain and design domain based on historical manufacturing data. An Integer Programming model is developed, for the first time, to extract association rules between sets of various product features and manufacturing capabilities used in their production. These associations identify the specific manufacturing system capabilities associated with (i.e. typically used for) the production of each product feature. The discovered knowledge is then used to synthesize the required manufacturing system capabilities for new products with new combinations of features. The proposed IP model was demonstrated using a case study of seven instances of machined parts and the corresponding milling machines used to produce them. The advantages of the proposed association rule discovery IP model were also demonstrated by comparing it with existing association rule discovery methods. The proposed model is simple and easy to implement and automate. Utilizing the proposed model in manufacturing system synthesis should greatly assist in speeding-up product development and manufacturing systems design and re-design. {\copyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In this study, we show that the design knowledge found by MODE is fruitful for decision making at a conceptual design stage of real world example i.e. contour design of a fuel efficient tire. Our procedure of MODE consists of nonlinear FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to predict tire performance, evolutional computation to get desirable solutions including Pareto solution, and data mining to find out design knowledge. SOM (Self-Organizing Map) and decision tree are used to obtain appropriate design variables and their threshold. In this study, SOM with MLS (Moving Least Square) filter is proposed to obtain the structured smooth data of design variables in an objective function space. We can overlook the whole causation with the objective functions and the design variables using this map. On the other hand, the decision tree gives a rule to get the aimed performance balance. In order to demonstrate the validity of the knowledge, we produced prototype tires. The experimental results of them guaranteed the validity and the effectiveness of the knowledge and MODE. Furthermore, the latest fuel efficient tire, which was designed based on the obtained knowledge, was released in July 2013.},

 abstract = {Ship design is related to several disciplines such as hydrostatic, resistance, propulsion and economic. The traditional ship design process only involves independent design optimization with some regression formulas within each discipline and there is no guarantee to achieve the optimum design. At the same time, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of modern ship design. Nowadays, the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been brought into the ship design optimization. However, there are still some problems such as calculation precision and time consumption especially when CFD software is inlaid into the optimization procedure. Modeling is a far-ranging and all-around subject, and its precision directly affects the scientific decision in future. How to establish an accurate approximation model instead of the CFD calculation will be the key problem. The Support Vector Machines (SVM), a new general machine learning method based on the frame of statistical learning theory, may solve the problems in sample space and be an effective method of processing the non-liner classification and regression. The classical SVR has two parameters to control the errors. A new algorithm of Support Vector Regression proposed in this article has only one parameter to control the errors, adds b(2)/2 to the item of confidence interval at the same time, and adopts the Laplace loss function. It is named Single-parameter Lagrangian Support Vector Regression (SPL-SVR). This effective algorithm can improve the operation speed of program to a certain extent, and has better fitting precision. In practical design of ship, Design of Experiment (DOE) and the proposed support vector regression algorithm are applied to ship design optimization to construct statistical approximation model in this paper. The support vector regression algorithm approximates the optimization model and is updated during the optimization process to improve accuracy. The result indicates that the SPL-SVR method to establish approximate models can effectively solve complex engineering design optimization problem. Finally, some suggestions on the future improvements are proposed.},

 abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) assisted by a digital twin is expected to revolutionize the realization of high-value and high-complexity functional parts on a global scale. Machine learning (ML) introduced in digitized AM provides potential to transform AM data into knowledge continuously and automatically; hence AM products will be designed and manufactured with improved quality. Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Great design often results from intelligently balancing tradeoffs and leveraging of synergies between multiple product goals. While the engineering design community has numerous tools for managing the interface between functional goals in products, there are currently no formalized methods to concurrently optimize stylistic form and functional requirements. This research develops a method to coordinate seemingly disparate but highly related goals of stylistic form and functional constraints in computational design. An artificial neural network (ANN) based machine learning system was developed to model surveyed consumer judgments of stylistic form quantitatively. Coupling this quantitative model of stylistic form with a genetic algorithm (GA) enables computers to concurrently account for multiple objectives in the domains of stylistic form and more traditional functional performance evaluation within the same quantitative framework. This coupling then opens the door for computers to automatically generate products that not only work well but also convey desired styles to consumers. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4007304]},

@article{Senhora.2022,
 abstract = {The high computational cost of topology optimization has prevented its widespread use as a generative design tool. To reduce this computational cost, we propose an artificial intelligence approach to drastically accelerate topology optimization without sacrificing its accuracy. The resulting AI-driven topology optimization can fully capture the underlying physics of the problem. As a result, the machine learning model, which consists of a convolutional neural network with residual links, is able to generalize what it learned from the training set to solve a wide variety of problems with different geometries, boundary conditions, mesh sizes, volume fractions and filter radius. We train the machine learning model separately from the topology optimization, which allows us to achieve a considerable speedup (up to 30 times faster than traditional topology optimization). Through several design examples, we demonstrate that the proposed AI-driven topology optimization framework is effective, scalable and efficient. The speedup enabled by the framework makes topology optimization a more attractive tool for engineers in search of lighter and stronger structures, with the potential to revolutionize the engineering design process. Although this work focuses on compliance minimization problems, the proposed framework can be generalized to other objective functions, constraints and physics.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Machine Learning (ML), part of Artificial Intelligence, is one of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0. ML appears to be an effective, affordable, accurate and scalable technique to cost mechanical parts in the early stage of the design process. Despite the cost estimation methods proposed in the literature, their application in specific real industrial contexts (e.g., engineered-to-order products) is minimal. This paper presents an innovative method for developing ML-based parametric cost models. The training data set is generated thanks to an analytical and automatic software tool for cost estimation. The data is subsequently processed using the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining -- CRISP-DM method. CRISP-DM is a process model for data science and representation. It provides an overview of the data mining life cycle. Its flexibility and easy customisation allow the creation of a data mining model that fits the goal of this work. The proposed method was employed to develop two cost models (semi-finishing and finishing phases) for components (disks) of a gas turbine. Gradient Boosted Trees turned out to be the best-performing prediction algorithm. Design engineers successfully used the generated cost models while configuring the gas-turbine cross-section. {\copyright} The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

@article{Manuguerra.2024,
 abstract = {Environmental managers attempt to increasingly incorporate precautionary principles into decision making. The literature lacks Machine Learning -based approaches for forewarning lifecycle environmental impacts. This paper proposes a method to support electric vehicle design. The main innovation of the work lays in merging Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Machine Learning foundations to provide support and awareness to designers. The present approach overcomes the present literature because it provides a method for the design phase, is based on a well-established methodology (LCA) and provides quantitative results from little inputs. The approach exploits machine Learning Methods to develop models with the design features of a generic electric vehicle (such as vehicle mass and distance traveled) in six phases (Problem definition; Data collection; Data Preparation; Modeling; Model evaluation; Model interpretation). Differently from existing environmental analyses, all stages of the product life cycle have been considered in building the database; moreover, the model provides quantitative results. Regression models and supervised algorithms were used. The obtained model can be used by product engineers, as well as those not experts on LCA. Moreover, the model guarantees the database and hypothesis's uniqueness, ensuring the results coherence and comparability. The level of accuracy obtained in the case study (error or 17{\%}) is comparable with studies handling full environmental analysis (that should be more accurate), and outstanding, as the present case is for the design phase. Future works will focus on additional significative indicators, similar electric vehicle design and integration with prospective LCA approaches. {\copyright} 2024 The Authors},

@article{Padhi.2024,
 abstract = {In this work we propose a novel deep learning assisted topology optimization model that predicts the final optimization result (which is usually obtained through hundreds of redesign/trial-error iterations) from only a few initial redesign iterations and few fine tuning iterations. The broad idea is to sandwich a deep learning model between the initial redesign iterations and the fine tuning iterations. The deep learning model acts as a surrogate model and allows us to learn the evolution law in an efficient manner. Although the proposed framework can accommodate any deep learning model, we have used the state-of-the-art flow based generative model. The flow based model takes the topological configurations from the initial redesign steps as input and yields the optimal configuration which is then further fine tuned by running the topology optimization algorithm for a few iterations. The final fine tuning topology optimization iteration assures structural soundness and integrity of the optimized configuration. The total computation time of this model is seen to be significantly less than the standard topology optimization routines. The generalization capability of this framework is demonstrated by having promising result in design domains with different boundary and loading conditions (dynamic and multiple point-loads). More interestingly, the proposed model generalizes to nonlinear systems without any retraining. Overall the proposed framework is robust and can be used as an alternative tool in conceptual design optimization process. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Deep generative models have demonstrated effectiveness in learning compact and expressive design representations that significantly improve geometric design optimization. However, these models do not consider the uncertainty introduced by manufacturing or fabrication. The past work that quantifies such uncertainty often makes simplifying assumptions on geometric variations, while the {\textquotedbl}real-world, {\textquotedbl} {\textquotedbl}free-form {\textquotedbl} uncertainty and its impact on design performance are difficult to quantify due to the high dimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a generative adversarial network-based design under uncertainty framework (GAN-DUF), which contains a deep generative model that simultaneously learns a compact representation of nominal (ideal) designs and the conditional distribution of fabricated designs given any nominal design. This opens up new possibilities of (1) building a universal uncertainty quantification model compatible with both shape and topological designs, (2) modeling free-form geometric uncertainties without the need to make any assumptions on the distribution of geometric variability, and (3) allowing fast prediction of uncertainties for new nominal designs. We can combine the proposed deep generative model with robust design optimization or reliability-based design optimization for design under uncertainty. We demonstrated the framework on two real-world engineering design examples and showed its capability of finding the solution that possesses better performance after fabrication.},

 abstract = {In engineering design, origami structures are frequently characterized by their geometry-shifting behavior, mechanical properties, lightness, and appealing aesthetic qualities. In particular, conical origami structures have attracted increasing attention in recent years owing to their excellent energy absorption performance. However, designing conical structures with customizable geometry and folding morphology has remained a less explored research area. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework is proposed for the customizable design of conical origami structures. To this end, first, the geometric relationships between the 2D crease patterns and 3D structures have been derived to determine the critical parameters. Subsequently, a data-driven method based on a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to train and predict the relationship among these critical parameters to facilitate the parametric design of conical origami structures. Importantly, although the DNN model is trained based on a limited set of data, error analyses demonstrate that the predicted crease patterns are in satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions, verified by physical models. Moreover, numerical simulations are performed to reveal the folding morphology and ensure the smooth deployment of the origami structures. Finally, the findings of this study indicate that conical origami structures are promising choices for further research and development in the area of lightweight energy-absorption structures.},

 abstract = {Nature has undergone millions of years of evolution, enabling organisms to adapt and survive in their environment. The remarkable features developed by these organisms serve as a rich source of inspiration for designers involved in engineering design. However, the effective application of bio-inspired design faces challenges due to the gap between biology and engineering, as well as the limited level of design automation. This paper proposes a bio-inspired generative design framework (BIGD), containing three main steps of dataset building, generator modeling, and design evaluation, which aims to automatically produce innovative designs by synthesizing a diverse range of natural designs using deep generative models. Specifically, a computational workflow is established for automated bio-inspired wing shape synthesis. The process of constructing a dataset typically involves web crawling data from various sources, followed by data preprocessing to ensure clarity. The data is then structured with prior knowledge from the biological domain and outliers are excluded. Finally, design knowledge is extracted through data mining and knowledge extraction techniques. In the case of a flapping wing shape design, the deep generative model is constructed using a bird wing dataset created with a strong foundation in biological domain knowledge. The wings generated by BIGD exhibit superior lift performance across a range of working conditions, showcasing the advantages of using BIGD to directionally guide the evolution of generative models based on biological knowledge. This research highlights the potential of using computational methods in bio-inspired design to rapidly generate innovative and high-performance designs.},

Typically, material costs comprise a large part of total manufacturing costs, and therefore obtaining an early estimate of material costs can help businesses in predicting the total manufacturing costs more accurately. At the early stage of product development, with many imponderables and frequent design modifications, it would be impractical to obtain quotations from suppliers. We, therefore, developed a two-stage machine learning scheme estimating the material cost to guide alternative product design choices that yield a lower total manufacturing cost. Our innovative two-stage technique for cost estimation is meant to overcome this issue.

The application of machine learning methods allows for utilizing existing knowledge and datasets from different sources, such as previous experiments, CFD, low-fidelity simulations, 1D or system-level studies. The present study investigates inserting a machine learning model that utilizes such data into a high-fidelity CFD driven optimization process, and hence effectively reduces the number of required evaluations of the CFD model. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were trained on data from over three thousand two-dimensional (2D) CFD analyses of turbine blade cross-sections. The trained ANN models were then used as surrogates in a nested optimization process alongside a full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes CFD simulation. The much lower evaluation cost of the ANN model allows for tens of thousands of design evaluations to guide the search of the best blade profiles to be used in the more expensive, high-fidelity CFD runs, improving the progress of the optimization while reducing the required computation time. It is estimated that the current workflow achieves a five-fold reduction in computational time in comparison to an optimization process that is based on three-dimensional (3D) CFD simulations alone. The methodology is demonstrated on the NASA/General Electric Energy Efficient Engine (E3) high pressure turbine blade and found Pareto front designs with improved blade efficiency and power over the baseline. Quantitative analysis of the optimization data reveals that some design parameters in the present study are more influential than others, such as the lean angle and tip scaling factor. Examining the optimized designs also provides insight into the physics, showing that the optimized designs have a lower amount of pressure drop near the trailing edge, but have an earlier onset of pressure drop on the suction side surface when compared to the baseline design, contributing to the observed improvements in efficiency and power.},

 abstract = {With the continual innovation of technology and product design methods, consumer needs change, and there is a gradual shift in product development from a function-oriented to consumer-oriented approach. The transformation of consumer perceptions into product design elements has become the focus of designers. This study develops an automated design generation system for product forms, which assists product designers to rapidly incorporate the consumer perceptions on the product form into the design process. It combines the Kansei engineering theory with the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), using the side-view contouring of cars as a case study. A questionnaire is given to the participants for selecting the top six subjective terms perceived by consumers in car styling. Further, 1006 car side views are scored on the six Kansei characteristics using a semantic differential scale. The results are clustered and analysed using fuzzy c-means. Subsequently, the clusters are applied as training datasets for the DCGAN, which generates antagonistic data to support the design process. The results of this study show that the data generated through the proposed method can facilitate designers in adjusting the product shape and realising an efficiently product shape design that matches the consumer's desired imagery. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

 abstract = {Limiting global warming's effects requires a sudden reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to pursue a net-zero carbon growth in the next decades. Along with this energy transition, drastic and rapid changes in demand are expected in many sectors, including the one for centrifugal compressors. In this context, new aerodynamic design processes exploiting the know-how of existing impeller families to generate novel centrifugal compressors could quickly react to demand variations and ensure companies' success. Modifying the characteristics of existing compressors using a 1D single-zone model is a fast way to exploit this know-how. Besides, artificial intelligence could be useful to highlight relationships between geometrical parameters and performance, thus facilitating the achievement of optimized machines for new applications. Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mono-dimensional approaches, the joint use of a 1D single-zone model with an artificial neural network for designing new impellers from pre-engineered ones remains understudied. Such a model was provided in this paper. An application to the case study of an expander-compressor impeller family derived from other existing natural gas liquefaction one was presented. Results proved that the proposed model enabled developing a new family from an existing one, improving the performance while containing design time and computational efforts.},

 abstract = {In product development, decisions about the appearance of the product are risky and difficult to make. Engineers and designers are aware that adding new design features or form design elements can degrade the visual appearance. Therefore, it is important to understand how future users perceive different design configurations. In this paper, an adapted Kansei Engineering (KE) methodology focusing on the extraction of affective attributes in product design is presented. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in which we investigated the influence of e-bike form design elements on user perception. The study was conducted using 15 pairwise adjectives to describe feelings and a set of collected e-bike image samples with different product designs, converted to silhouettes. In addition to methodological refinement, a space of properties, specifically form design elements were categorised based on VDI 2223 guidelines. Semantic space was defined using predefined affective attributes and later reduced using factor analysis, while e-bike image similarity was exploited using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) method. Influential form design elements were extracted using the decision tree method for classification based on a C4.5 algorithm. Using this methodology, we succeeded in discovering key form design elements that determine user perception.},

 abstract = {An accurate forecast of the final manufacturing costs in the early product development phase is a key element, especially in mechanical engineering. An accurate and reliable prediction allows, on the one hand, estimating the economic feasibility and, on the other hand, deriving necessary cost reductions. It is essential to evaluate and monitor compliance with the cost target initially and throughout the entire development process. Most cost estimation methods are primarily based on simple heuristic and statistical approaches that provide only limited accurate predictions in the early development phase. Sufficiently precise cost estimations, especially for customer-specific developments, are only possible in the late phase of the development process using finely parameterized models and cost rates at the component level. The supporting use of Machine Learning (ML) has not yet played a major role in cost estimation in mechanical engineering. Therefore, this article shows the general applicability of ML for predicting manufacturing costs in mechanical engineering and that even in the early phase of product development, precise predictions with little known information about the final product are possible. In addition, we present a generic feature set for ML-based cost prediction regarding machinery. Furthermore, the quality of different created ML models was evaluated based on real data of a mechanical engineering use case, and high accuracy in predicting manufacturing costs was demonstrated. {\copyright} 2022 The Authors.

@article{Huo.2022,
 abstract = {Many works based on case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) have been done to obtain a product concept intelligently, but researches on automatic and intelligent methods for the detailed design process are still lacking. To achieve the intelligent design of the whole process for mechanical product development, an approach based on cases and knowledge is proposed. First, considering that the actual product cases sample is small, correlations among product features and relationships between product features and requirements are evaluated based on design knowledge. According to these correlations and relationships, a design problem is decomposed into multiple parallel small-scale sub-problems not only to increase data samples but reduce data dimensions. Moreover, a hybrid method that combined Hamming distance with Euclidean distance is generated to retrieve similar cases, which can address both numerical and encoding factors. In addition, K-NearestNeighbor (KNN) algorithm and Linear regression are adopted to adapt the classification and numeric parameters, respectively, so that the detailed design process can be achieved without fixed knowledge template. Finally, a tool design software is developed based on Visual studio 2015 to verify the practicability of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Product development is a highly complex process that has to be individually adapted depending on the companies involved, the product to be developed and the related designers. Within this process, the approach and the know-how of the designer are very individual and can often only be described with high effort in a rule-based manner. Nevertheless, numerous routine tasks can be identified that offer enormous automation potential. Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning, has proven an immense capability to identify patterns and extract knowledge out of complex data sets. Autoencoder networks are suitable for the conversion of different 3D input data, e.g. Point Clouds, into compact latent representations and vice versa. Point Clouds are a universal representation of 3D objects and can be derived from various 3D data formats. The goal of the approach presented is to use Deep Learning algorithms to identify design patterns specific to a product family out of their underlying latent representation and use the extracted knowledge to automatically generate new latent object representations fulfilling distinct product feature specifications. A deep Autoencoder network with state-of-the-art reconstruction quality is used to encode Point Clouds into latent representations. In this approach, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network operating in latent space for generation of class-, characteristic- and dimension-conditioned objects is introduced. The model is quantitatively evaluated by a comparison of given specifications and the implemented features of generated objects. The presented findings can be used to support designers in the creation process by automatically proposing appropriate objects as well as in the adaption of future product variants to different requirements. This relieves the designer of time-consuming routine tasks and reduces the effort of knowledge-transfer between designers significantly. {\copyright} 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@inproceedings{Krahe.2022b,
 abstract = {Engineering competence and the digitization of all processes along the product development process are highly decisive for today's success of industrial companies. The design process is very individual and strongly based on design engineers' experience. Part of this knowledge and the result of the design approach are fixated in the existing variations of the product generations, but are difficult to extract and to formalize. Conclusions about design-related patterns between products of different generations or variants can be drawn from the model tree representing the design engineer's thinking process for each individual CAD model. However, the model tree has hardly been used so far. The aim of this paper is to examine whether there exist any common design patterns between CAD models of certain component classes by the exemplary use case in the area of mechanical engineering. To identify patterns and to extract knowledge out of complex data sets, Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Learning, has proven an immense capability. Finally, based on the learned patterns, meaningful next design steps are to be proposed in the form of an assistance system. The results show that there exist common design patterns for various classes of components. It is illustrated on an exemplary component class that those patterns can be used to train an assistance system based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The corresponding design patterns were extracted from data of an industrial application partner. By transferring these design patterns to the development of new product generations or variants, on the one hand the design process itself and thus the time to market can be shortened. On the other hand, the knowledge from previous product generations contained in those patterns can be preserved. For further research the design patterns of CAD models extracted by ML algorithms is a contribution to faster knowledge extrapolation. {\copyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

@inproceedings{Krahe.2022c,
 abstract = {Today, companies are faced with the challenge to develop and produce individualized products in the shortest possible time at very low cost in order to remain attractive under strong competitive pressure. For reasons of efficiency, products are therefore often developed in generations. Proven components are adopted in a new product generation and only some of the components are newly developed to meet new customer requirements. Many companies, therefore, have a large database of 3D CAD product models containing years of engineering experience. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to execute database queries to find which products or components already exist and could be reused or adapted for a new product generation or variant. As a result, many duplicates are created, which are associated with high effort and costs, and the risk of introducing design errors increases. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop an automated approach for geometric similarity search that also takes company-specific features of components into account. Machine learning methods are capable of automatically extracting relevant geometric features by learning a suitable representation of the corresponding 3D object. For this purpose, an autoencoder is developed which is trained to extract class-specific feature vectors. To improve the representativeness of those vectors for the similarity search, the architecture and hyperparameters of the autoencoder are optimized based on several experiments. Considering a real use case with a data set from the field of mechanical engineering, it is shown that geometrically similar CAD models can be found very quickly using the learned representation, and that better results are obtained than with conventional methods based on meta information, e.g. volume and bounding box. On the one hand, the fast finding of similar models encourages the reuse of existing solutions. On the other hand, standardization and, thus, economy of scale is promoted. {\copyright} 2022 The Authors.},

@article{Singh.2023,
 abstract = {The consideration of sustainability aspects in initial stages of product development is understood as an effective approach to plan a sustainable product life cycle. It can be achieved by integrating the sustainability consider-ations into decision making of companies in early design phases. This study aims to develop an Artificial In-telligence (AI) tool that can assist the designers in their decision making to choose environmentally benign design parameters of products. The proposed tool is based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model which takes the life cycle design parameters (viz. size of product, density of material, manufacturing process, transport mode and recyclability) as inputs and provides the corresponding outputs in terms of 'carbon footprint' and 'life cycle cost' of a product. These outputs assist the designers to realize the trade-off between the environmental load and cost effectiveness of a design alternative. Thus, it enables the decision making of companies to select a more sus-tainable design. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed for the AI tool so that the designers can efficiently use this tool. The results predicted by the proposed tool are compared with the results obtained through the life cycle assessment carried out by using GaBi 9.2. The comparison shows that the results predicted by the tool have a reasonable accuracy of more than 90{\%} which is significant, especially in the design stages of environmentally conscious product development. Also, the time efficiency of the tool to compute the environmental impact was compared with that of GaBi 9.2 by using a T-test. Results showed that the time efficiency of the proposed AI tool is significantly higher than that of GaBi 9.2.},
