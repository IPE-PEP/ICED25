 abstract = {This paper explores consumer green consumption practices and considers a set of factors, including cognitive and behavioural level constructs, that influence green consumption. The paper primarily aims to predict the green purchase intention and classify a consumer as a green or non-green consumer. A total of 310 responses were collected and analyzed using machine Learning techniques like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Machine, and the models were validated using different performance metrics. The paper reveals that the main driving factors for a consumer to consider greener options are green self-identification, followed by environmental knowledge, environmental consciousness, and the impact of social media. The current work will allow better product development and the targeting and positioning of green products/services offerings to customers already classified by the system. {\copyright} 2024 The Authors},

 abstract = {Due to the dynamic and competitive market environment, it is widely recognized that the development of new products and processes has become the critical point of attention for many companies. The first step in the product development process is to define the nature and function of the product, which is to classify the new product. The traditional product classification process only focuses on the product and market, which is developed by designers on the basis of the products of past dynasties. This way is labor-consuming, inefficient, and has become a bottleneck or constraint for these enterprises to improve their productivities and regulate production. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has been applied in a wide range of fields including product classification. How to apply machine learning technologies to solve the classification problem of product classification has been widely concerned by researchers. In this paper, a fast and effective product classification, called MdmNet, is proposed, which is based on a novel attempt that embeds the innovation idea of human in machine learning technologies. MdmNet includes three modules: a target customer modeling method based on the deep learning technologies a consumer information deduction method based on the MDM that builds a consumer feature closed loop and output the classification result of the consumers' perspective, and a weighted fusion module. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets Cars demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed MdmNet. This paper first attempts to add consumer motivation analysis to traditional machine learning method, which has a strong application prospect.},

 abstract = {Social media platforms are considered one of the most effective intermediaries for companies to interact with consumers. Social media-based decision support systems for the marketing domain are highly developed, but product development and innovation-oriented studies remain limited. This study offers a novel approach which utilises opinion retrieval theme along with sentiment analysis to support the decision-making process for product analysis and development. To achieve this aim, we propose an end-to-end social media-based opinion retrieval system and utilise machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Google Glass is chosen as a usecase as this product was unable to achieve its commercial targets despite its superior technological offerings. We design a multi-task deep neural network architecture for the training of sentiment prediction and opinion detection tasks. We first divide the tweets containing certain useful opinions and suggestions into two categories based on their sentiment labels. The negative tweets are analysed to identify product-related concerns, whereas the positive and neutral tweets are used to extract innovative ideas and identify new use cases for product development. We visualise and interpret the clusters of keywords extracted from each sentiment label group. Apart from methodological contributions, this study offers practical contributions for the next generations of smart glasses.},

 abstract = {The availability of social media-based data creates opportunities to obtain information about consumers, trends, companies and technologies using text mining techniques. However, the quality of the data is a significant concern for social media-based analyses. The aim of this study was to mine tweets (microblogs) to explore trends and retrieve ideas for various purposes such as product development, technology and sustainability-oriented considerations. The core methodological approach was to create a classification model to identify tweets that contained an idea. This classification model was used as a pre-processing step so the query results obtained from the application programming interface were cleared from the messages that contained the search terms used in the query but did not contain an idea. The results of this study demonstrate that our method based on text mining, and supervised or semi-supervised classification methods, can extract ideas from social media. The social media data mining process illustrated in our study can be utilised as a decision-making tool to detect innovative ideas or solutions about a product or service and summarise them into meaningful clusters. We believe that our findings are significant for the sustainability, tech mining and innovation management communities.},

 abstract = {Customer-to-manufacturer (C2M) is an emerging smart manufacturing strategy. In C2M, customers are directly connected with manufacturers for tailor-made product development and manufacturing. Thus, the R{\&}D and marketing-driven process in traditional manufacturing evolves into a customer-driven product development process. Product sales using the C2M mode have been one of the highest growth sectors in Chinese ecommerce platforms. However, customers usually lack the necessary domain knowledge. They cannot communicate directly with engineers by indicating the desired technical specifications of the product. A semantic gap exists. This paper presents a dual convolutional neural network- (CNN) -based structure, to automatically address this semantic gap. To mitigate the data sparsity issue in the customer needs domain, we use a massive amount of product review texts which were crawled from ecommerce websites to build a source mapping from reviews to product technical specifications. A small amount of customer needs text was deployed to adapt the source mapping to the target customer needs-product specifications mapping and thus close the semantic gap. Promising experiment results were obtained to show the effectiveness of the method.},

Among many, customer needs analysis for product ecosystems is one of the most challenging tasks in creating a successful product ecosystem from both the perspectives of marketing research and product development. In this paper, we propose a machine -learning approach to customer needs analysis for product ecosystems by examining a large amount of online user-generated product reviews within a product ecosystem. First, we filtered out uninformative reviews from the informative reviews using a fastText technique. Then, we extract a variety of topics with regard to customer needs using a topic modeling technique named latent Dirichlet allocation. In addition, we applied a rule -based sentiment analysis method to predict not only the sentiment of the reviews but also their sentiment intensity values. Finally, we categorized customer needs related to different topics extracted using an analytic Kano model based on the dissatisfaction -satisfaction pairfrom the sentiment analysis. A case example of the Amazon product ecosystem was used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed method.},

@article{Alkahtani.2019,
 abstract = {Analysis of warranty based big data has gained considerable attention due to its potential for improving the quality of products whilst minimizing warranty costs. Similarly, customer feedback information and warranty claims, which are commonly stored in warranty databases might be analyzed to improve quality and reliability and reduce costs in areas, including product development processes, advanced product design, and manufacturing. However, three challenges exist, firstly to accurately identify manufacturing faults from these multiple sources of heterogeneous textual data. Secondly, accurately mapping the identified manufacturing faults with the appropriate design information and thirdly, using these mappings to simultaneously optimize costs, design parameters and tolerances. This paper proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) based on novel integrated stepwise methodologies including ontology-based text mining, self-organizing maps, reliability and cost optimization for identifying manufacturing faults, mapping them to design information and finally optimizing design parameters for maximum reliability and minimum cost respectively. The DSS analyses warranty databases which collect the warranty failure information from the customers in a textual format. To extract the hidden knowledge from this, an ontology-based text mining based approach is adopted. A data mining based approach using Self Organizing Maps (SOM) has been proposed to draw information from the warranty database and to relate it to the manufacturing data. The clusters obtained using SOM are analyzed to identify the critical regions, i.e., sections of the map where maximum defects occur. Finally, to facilitate the correct implementation of design parameter changes, the frequency and type of defects analyzed from warranty data are used to identify areas where improvements have resulted in the greatest reliability for the lowest cost. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Customers are segmented in today's commercial world. They analyze their consumers' behaviors and purchasing patterns and can assist them in generating profit. Customer segmentation refers to the process of categorizing a company's customers into groups based on their commonalities. Client segmentation is the process of determining how to interact with consumers in different groups to amplify the value of each customer to the company. Unsupervised machine learning is used to segment customers. There are many algorithms that can partition customers based on their behavior and other parameters, and our study's main goal is to cluster customers into various clusters based on their behavior patterns.

 abstract = {The increasing amounts of customer-generated content regarding a product or service published in Social Media are an important source of information for companies. Especially for product development projects or the design of service offers, the unbiased feedback expressed in so-called product reviews is most valuable. However, for the effective use of product review content, the development of automated text processing tools is essential; manual text processing approaches are very time-consuming and thus compromise the benefits provided from the extracted information. To date, automated text mining tools focus the analysis of customers preferences and emotions articulated within a product review. An automated extraction and analysis of customer-related content has not yet been investigated in detail. Customer-related content refers to information within a review, which does not primarily concern the product, but provide information about the customer himself, his usage behavior, personal environment and habits. This information is most generally expressed in an objective manner by the author (i.e. customer) and provides an authentic starting point for the identification of customer needs. Particularly for innovative product development, the consideration of customer habits and personal environment is highly relevant for the derivation of underlying needs, which can be more important than the knowledge of specific preferences regarding a product. The objective of this research is the development and validation of a text mining process for the extraction of objective content from product reviews. To this end, German reviews from Amazon.de regarding two product categories are collected and firstly annotated manually for validation reference. Thereafter, a text mining process is developed comprising text preparation, transformation, classification and performance evaluation. Three different classifiers are applied for performance comparison. {\copyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge 'from' and 'about' customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies.},

The aim of applying industrial IoT is to assist manufacturers manage and optimize the entire product manufacturing process to improve product quality and production efficiency. Data-driven product development is considered as one of the critical application scenarios of industrial IoT, which is used to acquire the satisfied and robust design solution according to customer demands. Performance analysis is an effective tool to identify whether the key performance have reached the requirements in data-driven product development. The existing performance analysis approaches mainly focus on the metamodel construction, however, the uncertainty and complexity in product development process are rarely considered. In response, this paper investigates a robust performance analysis approach in industrial IoT environment to help product developers forecast the performance parameters accurately. The service-oriented layered architecture of industrial IoT for product development is first described. Then a dimension reduction approach based on mutual information (MI) and outlier detection is proposed. A metamodel based on least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is established to conduct performance prediction process. Furthermore, the predicted performance analysis method based on confidence interval estimation is developed to deal with the uncertainty to improve the robustness of the forecasting results. Finally, a case study is given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {Voice of customer is typically captured through multiple connect points like surveys, warranty claims, social media, and so on. Customer verbatim is collected through these connect points to encourage free expression of opinion by customers. Such verbatim data is generally of high value and is typically analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for translating into influencing actions in manufacturing, customer service, marketing, and product development departments. One of the challenges in analyzing unstructured verbatim data is to map that data onto appropriate concern codes (CCCs), which are typically used in automotive firms for tracking quality and satisfaction metrics. These concern codes map to a hierarchy of function areas in the organization aimed at improving product, service and hence the customer's overall experience. In this paper, we discuss our approach to address the challenge of mapping customer verbatim to concern codes, which is a classical natural language text classification problem. In this work, verbatim inputs from transactional systems of quality office, warranty claims, issues matrix, surveys, and social media content are used. Diverse sources and format of these textual comments pose challenges with free flow writing, content, language, and abbreviations. We apply traditional approaches of word counts and TF-IDF for representing documents. Considering complexity of word relationships, we adopt word embedding using word2vec to derive document vector representation of text. Machine learning models are then used to classify customer comments into concern codes. As next steps, we plan to use translation techniques to extend this comment classification framework for English to other languages. Copyright {\copyright} 2017 SAE International.},

 abstract = {The elicitation of customer needs (CNs) is a critical step in product development. However, these needs are often expressed in ambiguous, simple language and not in the form of well-defined specifications, causing a semantic gap in the product development process. Traditional methods to bridge the gap rely heavily on human action. Product development teams need to manually link CNs to product specifications in an ad hoc manner. This may be infeasible for large product variant spaces or evolving product families. We propose a machine learning mechanism to automatically bridge the semantic gap. This task is considered as a classification problem, with CNs being the class. The mapping function from product specifications to CNs is learned from training data by using a support vector machine and decision tree classifier. Given a new product variant, the learnt classifier can determine the needs that the product variant can satisfy. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can achieve very high mapping accuracy. It can also shield product development teams from the tedious labour of linking CNs to product variants, and thus improve the efficiency of needs elicitation.},

 abstract = {Since the first release of Apple iPad in April 2010, tablet computers (or simply tablets) can be viewed as a new category of technological products for general consumers. To compete in the evolving market, it is expected that the manufacturers need to customize the design of tablets to satisfy different needs of customers. To support product customization in this context, one specific challenge is that the customer information of tablets is relatively limited due to the newness of the product category. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a data mining approach to analyze the online reviews that contain customer opinions towards tablet products. In this research, tablet usages are first classified according to three user types: personal, business and student. From the online reviews, association rule mining is applied to investigate what tablet attributes are desired by specific user types. To examine the approach, the online reviews were collected from the time between April 2010 (first release of Apple iPad) and May 2011. Then, the association rule results from that time are compared with the recent tablet products on the market. It is demonstrated that online reviews as the original customer information can provide relevant insights for product customization. {\copyright} 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

 abstract = {Large portion of product innovation and development is accomplished by customers and only a small segment of the customer population engages in such innovation activities. Empirical research has shown that users in this subgroup, called lead users, tend to experience needs before the rest of the marketplace and stand to benefit greatly by finding solutions to those needs. To meet the challenge of quickly and effectively identifying lead users and uncovering their innovation ideas, the authors propose a fast and systematic approach, called Fast Lead User IDentification (FLUID), utilizing data mining techniques to identify lead users on social networking sites. The paper describes the steps taken to build and optimize the FLUID system to effectively identify lead users on the micro-blogging site Twitter. This entails studies using validated lead user questionnaires resulting in clusters of lead and non-lead Twitter users for a single product. The gathered online user metadata and behavior are then used as training data for the automated system. An overview of data processing techniques and relations to the empirically derived lead user characteristics are presented. Finally, classification algorithms that help to separate lead users from non-lead users are discussed, including optimization leading to the validation of the proposed approach. By making use of data-mining techniques on data rich sites like social networking sites, the FLUID approach minimizes the resource and time costs in identifying lead users and this provides a step towards systematizing the fuzzy-front end of the new product development process. {\copyright} 2015 The Authors.

 abstract = {Customers prefer to purchase products with more features, but after using the products, they may become dissatisfied with the usability problems of the products. This phenomenon is called {\textquotedbl}feature fatigue{\textquotedbl}. Thus it is imperative to analyze product usability in product definition stage. However, most traditional methods of usability evaluation are generally carried out using prototypes which are not available until in the later stage of product development. This paper proposes an approach based on Web mining to analyze product usability. This approach uses the massive online customer reviews on analogous products and features as data source, which are easy to get from Web and can reflect the most updated customer opinions on product usability. Association rule mining techniques are adopted to extract customer opinions on the usability of product features. The Apriori algorithm is used for mining association rules, based on which a usability evaluation method is then presented. A case example is given to validate the proposed approach. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Hence, businesses should develop product designing that could satisfy the customers' requirements since this will increase the enterprise's competitiveness and it is an essential criterion to earning higher loyalties and profits.

(2) What features is more importance than others? (3) Can product design and planning for product lines/product collection be integrated with the knowledge of customers? (4) How can the rules help us to make a strategy during we design new digital camera? To investigate these research issues, the Apriori and C5.0 algorithms are methodologies of association rules and decision trees for data mining, which is implemented to mine customer's needs.

 abstract = {In this study, the extractive summarization using sentence embeddings generated by the finetuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models and the k-means clustering method has been investigated. To show how the BERT model can capture the knowledge in specific domains like engineering design and what it can produce after being finetuned based on domain-specific data sets, several BERT models are trained, and the sentence embeddings extracted from the finetuned models are used to generate summaries of a set of papers. Different evaluation methods are then applied to measure the quality of summarization results. Both the machine evaluation method Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and a human-based evaluation method are used for the comparison study. The results indicate that the BERT model finetuned with a larger dataset can generate summaries with more domain terminologies than the pretrained BERT model. Moreover, the summaries generated by BERT models have more contents overlapping with original documents than those obtained through other popular non-BERT-based models. The experimental results indicate that the BERT-based method can provide better and more informative summaries to engineers. It has also been demonstrated that the contextualized representations generated by BERT-based models can capture information in text and have better performance in applications like text summarizations after being trained by domain-specific data sets.},

To develop new models for utilizing industry datasets of customer preferences, browsing histories, and market surveys, several machine learning models, such as LSTM, DT, RF, and ANN, were used to quickly predict customer requirements with unprecedented accuracy. Based on the model performance evaluation, the ANN-factor was the most accurate, accounting for 96.67{\%}. Further, the demonstration would be performed following ANN-factor implementation since post-demonstrative performance indicates an increase in sales revenue by 30{\%}, customer engagement by 13.33{\%}, and market share by 25{\%}. This case demonstrates how the ML model has significantly changed the approach to business processes in the mobile gadget industry. The real-time demonstrated model contributed to fast decision-making, which further supported the ability to react to the market and further perform adjustments of changes formulated in product development and marketing. Consequently, the research findings could be learned and applied to industries such as non-innovative industries as well, which gain insights into happiness from changes and adjustments in business data. {\copyright} 2024, Collegium Basilea.

However, LCA reports are typically dense and technically complex, making it difficult for many engineering design project stakeholders to appropriately leverage the information found within them. Our work seeks to understand and improve the transfer of knowledge from LCA reports during the early stages of the design process, specifically leveraging the natural language capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we investigate how four LCA-and sustainability-centric prompting frameworks can extract relevant design knowledge from LCA reports, demonstrated through a case study where an LLM (ChatGPT) is prompted on a provided electric toothbrush LCA report. Key findings illustrate the prompting frameworks can establish high-level summaries and identify life-cycle specific information, but the development of specific and design-focused sub-prompts will allow for richer understanding. We envision designers can use these proposed frameworks to query an LLM to gain context and insights from relevant LCA reports. The proposed techniques serve as a basis for automatic knowledge extraction from life cycle documents, creating accessible information in a user-friendly manner for designers who look to develop life-cycle-informed products. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s).},

 abstract = {With drastic changes in technology and its converging power in new product development, technology convergence has long been considered imperative in the innovation literature. Despite these efforts, previous articles neglected the importance of technology convergence in identifying promising technologies. To address this limitation, this article assumes that patents with high mediating power for subsequent technology convergence are likely to be promising. For this purpose, this article proposes the concept of convergence distance, which is measured by the differences in IPCs in backward and forward citations of patents, and defines it as the mediating power of technology convergence. Three indicators are defined: convergence distance, convergence intensity, and convergence diversity. Using these convergence-related indicators, we developed a machine-learning model to predict promising technologies. Consequently, the models with new evolution indicators outperformed the original models. Moreover, our suggested indicators turned out to be very important for predicting promising technologies, implying that the mediating power of technology convergence is very important for predicting future promising technologies and should be considered very significant for technology opportunity discovery.  {\copyright} 1988-2012 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Quality Function Deployment (QFD) stands as a widely utilized toolkit in product development. It offers a systematic approach to analyze customer requirements (CRs) and convert them into engineering language for product design and production. By separating CRs and engineering characteristics (ECs), QFD ensures that the final product considers both technical aspects and customer usability. Despite its historical success, QFD encounters challenges in today's business landscape. The process is typically intricate, demanding in labor, and time-consuming. QFD teams, comprising customers, designers, engineers, marketing experts, and moderators, heavily rely on the experience and expertise of designers and engineers. Decision-making is integral to the QFD process, making it less adaptable to the current fiercely competitive and time-sensitive business environment. This paper introduces a streamlined QFD method, designed to automate the process rapidly and require fewer resources from companies. Leveraging extensive online product review text, our smart QFD method deduces the relationship between CRs and ECs. The application of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) aids in extracting features for the CRs-ECs mapping, facilitating the QFD process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GCN-based QFD structure. {\copyright} 2024 IEEE.},

In this rese arch work, we propose using sentiment analysis and social media mining an automatic engine which can be used for better product recommendation and automatic routing of relevant feedback to the product development teams. Our proposed solution is scheduled to run at regular intervals pulling dynamic reviews in an optimized manner with a lesser time complexity and higher efficiency. The reviews are collated from distributed platforms followed by building a domain classification engine on the principles of TF-IDF and Supervised Classifier. This system is used to classify the reviews of the respective enterprises. A sentiment analysis system is built using combined Rule-Based Mining and Supervised Learning Models which makes use of polarity to classify if the feedback is positive or negative. If the polarity is negative, the feedback gets routed to the concerned enterprise for immediate action and if the polarity is positive, it is passed to a user-based collaborative filtering engine which acts as a recommendation system. {\copyright} 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

 abstract = {This research breaks new ground by utilizing the advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for the extraction of voice of customer (VoC) data from online customer support interactions on Twitter. Traditional methods of VoC extraction have typically fallen short in capturing the richness and nuance of customer sentiment. Contemporary machine learning (ML) approaches, while improved, still struggle to interpret the contextual subtleties of digital customer communications effectively. This study showcases the innovative deployment of GPT-3.5 Turbo, demonstrating its superior performance in extracting VoC through a deeper understanding of conversational context and a more intuitive, chat-based data processing. Furthermore, the large-scale, multilingual processing capabilities of this model offer a more comprehensive and inclusive analysis of VoC. The study ties these advancements to Lean Six Sigma 4.0, illustrating how the integration of GPT-3.5 Turbo's transformative capabilities can elevate the customer-centric approach of Lean Six Sigma in the era of Industry 4.0. This innovative exploration points to a significant evolution in VoC analysis, offering potential for more insightful, real-time data--driven customer service strategies and a more substantial foundation for decision-making in product development and process improvement. Future research is encouraged to validate these preliminary findings and to investigate ethical considerations associated with the use of such advanced NLP models. {\copyright} The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.},

 abstract = {Understanding the perceptions of consumers is widely recognized as a critical element in the innovation of new products. Traditional techniques used by companies to collect essential consumer insights have largely remained unchanged. Common practices like interviews and surveys have distinct limitations. Interviews may not always capture the precise needs of consumers due to communication barriers, and surveys tend to encourage incremental changes rather than radical innovations. Service industries face further complexity as they navigate customer feedback on the more intangible aspects of service quality. This study highlights the pioneering use of GPT-3.5 Turbo, a tool known for its exceptional ability to delve into the nuances of conversational context and process data in a chat-centric manner, thereby enhancing the extraction of Voice of the Customer (VoC). Its capability to handle large volumes of data in multiple languages leads to a more thorough and inclusive VoC analysis. The study links these technological advancements with Lean Six Sigma 4.0, suggesting that incorporating GPT-3.5 Turbo could significantly improve the customer-focused strategies in the current industrial landscape. This breakthrough in VoC analysis suggests possibilities for more perceptive, immediate data-driven approaches in customer service, and lays a stronger groundwork for decisions in product evolution and process enhancement. The paper concludes by urging further investigation to confirm these initial results and to explore the ethical aspects of employing such advanced natural language processing technologies. {\copyright} 2024 The Author(s)},

 abstract = {Recently, online user-generated data have been used as an efficient resource for customer analysis. In the product design area, various methods for analyzing customer preference for product features have been suggested. However, most of them focused on feature categories rather than product components which are crucial in practical applications. To address that limitation, this paper proposes a new methodology for extracting sub-features from online data. First, the method detects phrases in the data and filtered them using product manual documents. The filtered phrases are embedded into vectors, and then they are divided into several groups by two clustering methods. The resulting clusters are labeled by analyzing items in each cluster. Finally, cue phrases for sub-features are obtained by selecting clusters with labels representing product features. The proposed methodology was tested on smartphone review data. The result provides feature clusters containing sub-feature phrases with high accuracy. The obtained cue phrases will be used in analyzing customer preferences for sub-features and this can help product designers determine the optimal component configuration in embodiment design.},

 abstract = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is essential in industries such as healthcare, automotive, and finance, where understanding customer feedback is crucial for business strategies and product development. Traditional sentiment analysis methods often fail to account for specific aspects, providing only generalized sentiment scores (polarities). This study aims to develop a robust ABSA architecture to accurately classify aspect-based sentiment polarity. We propose a Modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (M-LDA) model that integrates Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract relevant aspects. Additionally, an Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (O-BERT) model is used to determine aspect-based sentiment polarity, categorizing sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is then employed to enhance classification accuracy. The M-LDA O-BERTLSTM for ABSA (MOL-ABSA) performance, evaluated using accuracy and macro-F-score metrics on the SemEval 2014 and a generalized dataset, demonstrates its effectiveness, achieving accuracies of 81.19{\%}, 85.26{\%}, and 87.53{\%}, respectively. This integrated approach combines traditional NLP techniques with advanced machine learning models to ensure high accuracy. {\copyright} (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

 abstract = {The gradual adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) globally serves as a crucial move toward addressing global decarbonization goals for sustainable development. However, the lack of cost-effective, power-efficient, and safe chargers for EV batteries hampers adoption. Understanding the research needs and identifying the gaps in EV charger innovation informs investments and research to address development challenges. This study developed a unique text mining workflow to classify themes in EV charger technology and product development by analyzing U.S. patent award summaries. The text mining workflow combined the techniques of data extraction, data cleaning, natural language processing (NLP), statistical analysis, and unsupervised machine learning (ML) to extract unique themes and to visualize their relationships. There was a 47.7{\%} increase in the number of EV charger patents issued in 2022 relative to that in 2018. The top four themes were charging station management, power transfer efficiency, on-board charger design, and temperature management. More than half (53.8{\%}) of the EV charger patents issued over the five-year period from 2018 to 2022 addressed problems within those four themes. Patents that addressed wireless charging, fast charging, and fleet charging accounted for less than 10{\%} each of the EV charger patents issued. This suggests that the industry is still at the frontier of addressing those problems. This study further presents examples of the specific EV charger problems addressed within each theme. The findings can inform investment decisions and policymaking to focus on R{\&}D resources that will advance the state of the art and spur EV adoption.},

 abstract = {Eliciting informative user opinions from online reviews is a key success factor for innovative product design and development. The unstructured, noisy, and verbose nature of user reviews, however, often complicate large-scale need finding in a format useful for designers without losing important information. Recent advances in abstractive text summarization has created the opportunity to systematically generate opinion summaries from online reviews to inform the early stages of product design and development. However, two knowledge gaps hinder the applicability of opinion summarization methods in practice. First, there is a lack of formal mechanisms to guide the generative process with respect to different categories of product attributes and user sentiments. Second, the annotated training datasets needed for supervised training of abstractive summarization models are often difficult and costly to create. This article addresses these gaps by (1) devising an efficient computational framework for abstractive opinion summarization guided by specific product attributes and sentiment polarities, and (2) automatically generating a synthetic training dataset that captures various degrees of granularity and polarity. A hierarchical multi-instance attribute-sentiment inference mode is developed for assembling a high-quality synthetic dataset, which is utilized to fine-tune a pretrained language model for abstractive summary generation. Numerical experiments conducted on a large dataset scraped from three major e-Commerce retail store for apparel and footwear products indicate the performance, feasibility, and potentials of the developed framework. Several directions are provided for future exploration in the area of automated opinion summarization for user-centered design. {\copyright} 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Researchers have adjusted the measurements to become some NPD so that research variables may impact the firm, but they have not attempted to measure. The measuring component is crucial to give proper control over product development operations. It will employ a web-based tool for monitoring the growth of NPD skills in the field area. If the organization has identified an essential mastering function, you may create long-term objectives. To suggest the networks are employed in two phases, the second Neural Network (NN) model output is the value of the capacity level as NPD. Test and train data is utilized to select the NN. One technique to cope with uncertainty and risk in a NPD process is understanding the success of NPD in Critical Success Factors (CSFs). The relationship between the selection of key metrics and the accumulation of factors contributing to success is necessary in order to train a neural network to accurately predict the results of an NPD. Entering the data is acquired by a corporation in the electronics sector. Companies have adopted a new product development process and do not have a new process; however, these items may be changed.

 abstract = {Requirements for complex technical systems are documented in natural language sources. Manually extracting requirements from these documents - e.g., to transfer them to a requirements management tool - is time-consuming and error-prone. Today, machine learning approaches are used to classify natural language requirements and thus enable extraction of these requirements. However, in practice there is often not enough labeled domain-specific data available to train such models. For this reason, this work investigates the performance in artificially generating requirements through data augmentation. First, success criteria for a method for extracting and augmenting requirements are elicited in cooperation with industry experts. Second, the performance in the augmentation of requirements data is investigated. The results show that GPT-J is suitable for generating artificial requirements: weighted average F1-score: 62.74 {\%}. Third, a method is developed to extract requirements from specifications, augment requirements data, and then classify the requirements. As a final step, the method is evaluated with requirements data from three industry case examples of the engineering service provider EDAG Engineering GmbH: assembly latch hood, adjustable stopper hood and trunk curtain roller blind. Evaluation shows that especially the transferability of models is improved when they are trained with augmented data. The developed method facilitates eliciting complete requirements sets. Performance of artificial intelligence models in requirements extraction is improved applying augmented data and therefore the method leads to efficient product development.},

For the past decade and with the availability of online consumer reviews, companies and researchers have developed many approaches utilizing electronic Word-of-Mouth to improve and develop products and services to outperform competitors. The purpose of this study is to construct an effective method to perform a better product comparative analysis based on online consumer reviews. We propose a novel framework called Teardown Joint Sentiment-Topic analysis model consisting of a combination of text analytical approaches incorporated with a developed method of the traditional teardown analysis product comparative approach. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised model that employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to form topics which are classified according to their sentiments. Topics are then analyzed against competitive products and critical topics are identified using a developed teardown method. A case study analyzing online customer reviews of competing products in two domains (i.e., mobile phones and surveillance cameras) is conducted. The identified critical topics are further analyzed in view of products' specifications perspective. We found that the detected aspects of the selected products are indeed critical, and hence, they need to be improved in order to gain a competitive advantage. The significant result of this study shows that the proposed method is effective in conducting products comparative analysis and provides valuable insights into utilizing the consumer reviews for product development. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2021.},

Warranty claims analysis is a key activity for product support and product development technicians. A widely used source of information is a set of documents, referred to as 'Claim Comments' that are filled in by mechanics during repairs. Repair records include valuable information as failure modes descriptions, diagnosis and troubleshooting, potential causes, and other useful details. The information is then fed back for customer/field support and continuous product improvement. Claims details review is mostly executed manually, and engineers need to read thousands of lines each year. This task is constrained by human limitations - e.g., ability of consistently identifying failure modes and the limited number of documents that can be processed at once. This paper describes a solution to make that kind of massive documents analysis more scalable and efficient. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is not a new discipline in data science; however, the problem was tackled in an innovative way using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a semantic approach instead of the classic frequentist one. This means that the analysis is not limited to single words occurrences but relies on the whole text context understanding. The core technology is based on a deep neural network called BERT [2] (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which can read and understand the sentences, their context and enable the identification of the main topics in a set of documents. This solution can build topics-failure modes relationships, fostering an automated cross-system analysis previously unattainable. The developed application connects to the Enterprise Data System (EDS) through workflows embedded in a cloud-computing environment. The cloud environment allows managing large amounts of raw text, develop code, build data pipelines, schedule jobs, and manage distributed computer resources. The outcome is then delivered through dashboards that can easily convey the model's complexity in an interactive platform. Through the dashboards, users can analyze topics/failure modes across thousands of claims in a more efficient and effective way. The modular structure grants flexibility to the process, which is now able to adapt to different contexts and data sources. Main strengths of the developed solution are the automation and increased productivity for product support technicians, faster failure modes identification and prioritization and easier data exploration, presentation and sharing. {\copyright} 2024 IEEE.},

 abstract = {In today{\&}{\#}039;s competitive market, it is essential for producers to provide products which not only achieve high performance, but also appeal to the tastes of consumer. Therefore, a key element of design is an understanding of human preferences for products and features. In this work, a human appraisal experiment is conducted to understand preferences for automobile occupant package design. The experiment is conducted to build predictive parametric models of consumer preferences. An issue with this class of experiment is that the heterogeneity of the experimental respondents contributes to the response, and this heterogeneity must be understood to separate the influence of design factors from that of human factors. Latent class analysis is used to combine multiple responses of the human appraisal respondents to an appropriate set of measures. Cluster analysis and smoothing spline regression are used to gain an understanding of respondent rating styles and preference heterogeneity. These analyses allow estimation of ordered logit models for prediction of consumer occupant package preferences. Methods from machine learning are also investigated as an alternative to parametric modeling.},
